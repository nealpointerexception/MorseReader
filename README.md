# MorseReader
Parse morse code with your camera

### What does it do?
This program allows you to flash morse code to your computer
and decipher it with your camera! 


### How do I use it?
Before you can parse morse code, you need to calibrate the program.
To do this, run this program in calibration mode and flash ``` eeee ttt```
so that morse-parser can tune itself to your morse-ing speed whether you
are using and app or a real flashlight. Make sure all your light inputs are
within the green box onscreen!

After calibration, you are ready to use the program!  

## Libs:
